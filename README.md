<b>Design Patterns in C# 7.0</b>


In this repository I am doing some exercises and examples about the GOF design patterns in C# 7, so it's pretty much updated. There is a problem.jpg file on each project folder that is an exercise, and the solution is on the Program.cs file (with the Main method), there are also some other pratical examples.

Some considerations:

When to use the Builder and the Factory?

 "The Builder is only needed when an object cannot be produced in one step. One great an example of this would be in the de-serialization process for a complex object. Often times the parameters for the complex object must be retrieved one by one."
 
 What's the difference between the Composite Pattern and the Builder Pattern?
 
  "The composite pattern is used when you have a situation when you need to construct Parent and Child, like a dynamic menubar."
